# React Playground

I have started several React projects in the past and they're getting spread out all over the place since they were each their own repo/folder. This is an attempt to put all the React-based projects in one repository. Not sure if it's a good idea or not, but gonna try it and see what happens.

## Projects

The projects in this repository.

### react-theme-provider

Follows along with [this tutorial]([https://css-tricks.com/a-dark-mode-toggle-with-react-and-themeprovider/).

This project creates a dark/light mode switcher and is meant to be a learning mechanism for how to implement a theme switching mechanism in React.
